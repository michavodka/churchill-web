                <h2>What is Churchill House</h2>
                <div class="article-text">
                    <p> Churchill House displays several key features as follows:
                        <ul>

                            <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                            <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the
                                south and
                                east wings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping
                        structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun
                        protection,
                        and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this
                        style,
                        and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative
                        approach to the style because of the intended office use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their
                        understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.

                        Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd.
                        The
                        building was his last major commission.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the
                        Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia
                        in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and
                        he
                        died prior to its completion.
                        It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first
                        brutalist building.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the
                        separate north wing or pavilion;
                        the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north
                        wing
                        it encloses a courtyard with a
                        large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower
                        at
                        the southeast corner.
                        The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key
                        features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form
                        concrete,
                        sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for
                        sun
                        protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained
                        form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron
                        Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia.

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Churchill House was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of
                        Australia
                        in 1969-70 and construction was completed in 1971. The building is an example of the Late
                        Twentieth-Century Brutalist Style (1960-) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form
                        concrete.

                        The complex comprises a number of components: the main building with its east and south
                        wings,
                        the separate north wing or pavilion, the pool and the rear carpark. The main building forms
                        an L
                        shape in plan, and with the north wing it encloses on three sides a courtyard in which the
                        pool
                        is located. The main building is of three storeys with a four storey lift tower at the
                        southeast
                        corner, the north wing is of two storeys, and the carpark is two storeyed.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Main Building</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main building displays several different elevational treatments. The elevations facing
                        onto
                        the
                        pool area feature floor to ceiling glass with minimal black metal frames to the lowest
                        level,
                        and
                        precast vertical panels on the upper two storeys. Each panel has a projecting fin and are
                        relatively
                        narrow, with the overall affect being of closely spaced vertical fins. Beside the fins are
                        narrow,
                        slot windows providing minimal outlook onto the pool area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The south and east elevations are quite different in character having long horizontal
                        sections
                        of
                        flush-mounted glazing set in minimal black metal frames, with timber-textured off-form
                        concrete
                        spandrels between storeys. The base course of the elevation is a large section black-coated
                        steel
                        beam. Several window-mounted airconditioners are located on the south elevation. The blank
                        end
                        walls
                        of the wings and the lift tower are off-form, timber-textured concrete with incised storey
                        lines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the junction of the two wings are the foyers for each floor as well as the service core
                        including
                        the lift. Apart from the off-form concrete walls of the service elements, the foyers feature
                        glazing
                        set in black metal frames which extends the full height of the building. At the ground floor
                        level
                        the glazing is vertical but above that for the remaining two storeys it is sloping.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The building has concrete slab floors which are either carpeted or finished in slate. Some
                        interior
                        walls are textured, off-form concrete similar to the exterior. Other walls are lightweight
                        partitions. There is a mixture of ceiling treatments: off-form concrete, suspended ceilings
                        and
                        set
                        plasterboard. Many of the interior fitouts appear relatively modern and are not original.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The roof of the main building is set behind a parapet and appears to be graded concrete with
                        a
                        membrane coating.
                    </p>
                    <h2>North Wing</h2>
                    <p>The north wing replaces an earlier pavilion on the same location. The current wing is a two
                        storey
                        structure with a flat metal deck roof set behind a parapet. The wing has an encircling steel
                        colonnade which supports the roof and parapet. The walls are set back from the colonnade and
                        feature
                        flush-mounted glazing set in thin black metal frames, with textured off-form concrete
                        spandrels,
                        similar to the south wall of the south wing. There is an enclosed link between the north and
                        east
                        wings at the ground floor level.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Pool Area, Carpark and Landscaping.</h2>
                    <p>The pool area is lower than the surrounding site, and being mostly enclosed by the wings, has
                        the
                        quality of a sunken courtyard. The pool area is reached by a large flight of concrete steps
                        from
                        the
                        west, and features a pond which borders a large, raised central island which is reached from
                        one
                        side by a set of bridging steps. The island has concrete paving, garden beds and silver
                        birch
                        trees,
                        and is the location for a large fibreglass statue of Sir Winston Churchill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The carpark is constructed in off-form concrete, with walls displaying the texture of the
                        timber
                        formwork.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Churchill House has a number of landscape/garden areas. At the front (west) of the building
                        is
                        an
                        open lawn area and either side are mixed native/exotic plantings. The pool area contains
                        numerous
                        trees and shrubs, again of mixed native/exotic species. A small courtyard to the southeast
                        of
                        the
                        main building features bamboo.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Stylistic Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Churchill House displays several key features of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style
                        as
                        follows.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.

                        <li>
                            Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the
                            south
                            and east
                            wings.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style.</p>

                        <li>
                            Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at
                            the
                            corner
                            between the east and south wings.

                        None the less, the building retains substantial components and details of the original

                    <p>
                        Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919-1971) was a nationally and internationally renowned architect.
                        He
                        was also widely published and appreciated as an architectural critic. In 1953 Robin Boyd, Roy
                        Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the practice of Grounds, Romberg and Boyd which became a
                        leading architectural firm in Melbourne. The firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although the three partners were prominent as individuals, the firm maintained a strong design
                        unity. Some buildings revealed the hand of one or other of the architects, but in general the
                        firm
                        developed a corporate style, combining the philosophies of the trio and representing the
                        advanced
                        thinking of that era. They often worked or supervised on each other’s projects. Their work was a
                        distinctive Australian form of the International Style, then called Contemporary. (Clerehan,
                        1993).

                        Boyd joined the National Capital Planning Committee (NCPC) in January 1968 as one of two
                        architectural experts, the other being Professor Gordon Stephenson from Western Australia. Boyd
                        and
                        Stephenson were charged with creating a statement of civic design philosophy that would form the
                        basis of the NCDC policies relating to the Buildings (Design and Siting) Ordinance 1964. These
                        policies would guide the aesthetic, development principles and layout of buildings in the
                        National
                        Capital areas of Canberra.

                    <p>
                        Boyd had a prolific output of architectural designs, books and articles. He wrote over 700
                        articles
                        for journals and newspapers, presented a TV series on Modernism and was the author of Victorian
                        Modern: 111 Years of modern Architecture in the State of Victoria, Australia (1947); Australia’s
                        Home: Its Origins, Builders and Occupiers (1952); The Australian Ugliness (1960); Kenzo Tange

                        His architectural work is mostly known through his residential designs. He was known for his
                        ability
                        to design houses that would meet client needs, solve site problems and still retain
                        architectural
                        integrity. The designs were heavily influenced by the functional and international styles of
                        architecture and became known as the Melbourne Regional style. It was light, simple and elegant
                        and
                        unmistakably modern. (Architecture Today 1972; Saunders 1972; and Serle 1995)

                        In the 1960s he started to move away from the glass box functionalism of the International and
                        Melbourne Regional styles arguing that it had a limited range of expression and instead tried,
                        somewhat unsuccessfully, to land large prestigious commissions for advanced high-rise buildings.
                        He submitted many designs, but few were successful. <p>Those that he did win tended to be of a

                        Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began
                        consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968.
                        In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the
                        architect Robin Boyd to design the building.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental office
                        accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust. Features of
                        the original design included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a
                            display
                            on

                        <li>
                            The flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace;

                        <li>
                            Accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar
                            and
                            kitchen.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> The cost of the works was about $1 million. The building was officially opened on 14 April
                        1972.

                        Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged by the Trust as its site
                        representative to replace Boyd.

                        Robin Boyd CBE HFRAIA (1919-1971) is a noted Australian architect. Boyd was a member of a
                        prominent artistic family, and combined a career as an architect, author and critic
                        (Clerehan
                        1993). He was strongly influenced by the Modern Movement, and deeply interested in the
                        development of Australian architecture. Boyd is often remembered best for his domestic
                        architecture, as well as his books, but he also produced designs for larger scale works,
                        such as
                        in the case of Churchill House. Boyd was awarded the Gold Medal by the RAIA in 1969, and
                        made an
                        honorary fellow in 1970.

                        Boyd was strongly influenced later in his career by the post-war concrete architecture
                        produced
                        in Japan (Taylor 1990:80). This Brutalist style is evident in the design for Menzies College
                        Student Housing (1968) and in the design for Churchill House. In this latter phase, Boyd was
                        seeking larger scale projects, although with only limited success.

                        During the 1990s(?) the glass pavilion was replaced by the current north wing.

                        Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late Twentieth
                        Century
                        Brutalist style. These include:

                        Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of only two examples of an
                        office
                        building. While Brutalism has been described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic (Banham
                        1966:10), both office buildings display a more restrained form compared to the other
                        buildings,
                        several of which were intended to portray a distinctive image in the national capital.
