Assignment for Frontend web design @ UC (u3151142)
Throughout this assignment, I tried to bring information together, instead of having a new page for every item. I have created a tab for the linking of the information in the nav bar. But wanted a very simple, flowing website. I think that my webpage has brought my wireframe to life and that I stayed realtively true to my brief and pallette. Utilising neutral colours with a splash of neon to create a modern site. I think the site is easy enough and simple enough for people of all ages to use. 
With my navlinks that anchor on the same page (About, History, Contact) I would have made them the active style, but because I've set them up within one html (and can't figure this out...) and can't use javascript, I cannot give them the class needed for this function.
