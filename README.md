# Assignment for Front-End web design @ UC (u3151142)

## The Webpage
Throughout this assignment, I tried to bring information together, instead of having a new page for every item. I have created a tab for the linking of the information in the nav bar. But wanted a very simple, flowing website that was more efficient than clicking through page after page. Instead I nestled my main pages and content on one main page and linked the user with the nav bar.Whilst I have somewhat deviated from my original wireframe, I think that my webpage has been true to my wireframe in the elements I have used, just modernized and enhanced the user experience. I have changed some of the content around to try and apply it to my site better and make more sense of the grouping. For example, the Statement of Significance, I have made into three sentences instead of a paragraph and included the other information within the “History” tab of the site. This seemed like it provided more clarity and a truer “Statement of Significance” which to me, should be somewhat like a mission statement, short and to the point. 

I think I stayed relatively true to my brief and colour palettes; utilising neutral colours with a splash of neon to create a modern feel. The use of neon is also to draw attention to particular points that I think are of interest to the user. I think the site is easy enough and simple enough for people of all ages to use :fire::fire::fire:. 

## Difficulties
With my navlinks that anchor on the same page (About, History, Contact), I would have made them the active style, but because I've set them up within one html (and can't figure this out...) and can't use javascript, I cannot give them the class needed for this function :stuck_out_tongue:.

My biggest difficulty was around the image layout and linking my images correctly. Flex box didn't work how I wanted it to :sweat:. I wanted to arrange my gallery in columns of three, which I believe I need to use Grid for. I did not have much success in research and felt it was a little too ambitious for this assignment and my abilities.

Whilst this is something relatively new to me, I had a blast designing and creating this site.
